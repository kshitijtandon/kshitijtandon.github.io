I live in Melbourne, Australia, where I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au) working in the laboratory of [A/Prof. Heroen Verbruggen](https://hverbruggen.github.io//) on coral holobiont ecogenomics. Here, I drive the functional genomics and microbial ecology aspect of coral microbiome research to develop a comprehensive understanding of functional roles played by diverse coral microbiome members in coral health and resilience in light of climate change. To achieve this, I work with different omics data, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics. *My research interest* is in developing a hollistic understanding of the environmental microbiomes by using an integrative approach through the application of systems biology and metabolic networks.

I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics in 2020 at [Environmental microbiology lab](https://sltang.biodiv.tw/index.php) under the supervision of [Prof. Sen-Lin Tang, Biodiversity Research Center](https://sltang.biodiv.tw),[Academia Sinica,Taiwan](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) under the [Taiwan International Graduate Program on Bioinformatics](https://idv.sinica.edu.tw/tigpbio/index.html). My dissertation focussed on understanding the microbial community-functional relationships.

**Update** I will moving to [Melbourne Integrative Genomics](https://sites.research.unimelb.edu.au/integrative-genomics) in April, 2024 to start a new position with [Dr. Vanessa R Marcelino](https://www.hologenomics.org/).
