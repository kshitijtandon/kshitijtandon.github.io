I live in Melbourne, Australia, where I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [The University of Melbourne](www.unimelb.edu.au) working in the laboratory of [A/Prof. Heroen Verbruggen](www.phycoweb.net) on coral holobiont ecogenomics. Here, I drive the functional genomics and microbial ecology aspect of coral microbiome research to develop a comprehensive understanding of functional roles played by diverse coral microbiome members in coral health and resilience in light of climate change. To achieve this, I work with different omics data including, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics. My research interest is in developing a hollistic understanding of the environmental microbiomes by using an integrative approach through the application of systems biology and metabolic networks.  


I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Sen-Lin Tang, Biodiversity Research Center](), [Academia Sinica,Taiwan](www.academiasinica.edu.tw) under the [Taiwan International Graduate Program on Bioinformatics] (https://idv.sinica.edu.tw/tigpbio/index.html). My dissertation focussed on understanding the microbial community-functional relationships.
