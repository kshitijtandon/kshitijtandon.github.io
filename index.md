I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Melbourne Integrative Genomics](https://sites.research.unimelb.edu.au/integrative-genomics), University of Melbourne, working with [Dr. Vanessa R Marcelino](https://www.hologenomics.org/). My current research focuses on *developing genome-scale metabolic models of microbiome members* to investigate community-scale nutritional interactions and functional interdependencies within complex microbial ecosystems. This work aims to build predictive frameworks for microbiome function, with applications in health, disease, and environmental resilience.

My broader research interest lies in systems biology of environmental and host-associated microbiomes. I integrate multi-omics data—metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics—to explore the functional ecology of microbiomes and how they adapt to or influence dynamic environments. Through these approaches, I seek to understand how microbial communities contribute to host health and ecosystem stability.

I actively collaborate with researchers at the [Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity](https://www.doherty.edu.au) (with [Prof. Sammy Bedoui](https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/sammy_bedoui)) and the [Peter MacCallum Cancer Center](https://www.petermac.org) (with [Dr. Shahneen Sandhu](https://www.petermac.org/expert-finder/details/shahneen-sandhu)), bringing microbiome metabolic modeling into translational contexts such as infection, immunity, and cancer.

Previously, I worked with [A/Prof. Heroen Verbruggen](https://hverbruggen.github.io//) at the University of Melbourne on coral holobiont ecogenomics, investigating how microbial communities support coral health and resilience in the face of climate change.

I earned my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics in 2020 from the [Environmental Microbiology Lab](https://sltang.biodiv.tw/index.php), [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en), Taiwan, as part of the [Taiwan International Graduate Program in Bioinformatics](https://idv.sinica.edu.tw/tigpbio/index.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Sen-Lin Tang](https://sltang.biodiv.tw). My doctoral research focused on deciphering microbial community-function relationships in diverse environmental systems.

**Latest publication**: Integrating metatranscriptomics improves metabolic modelling. See [publications](https://kshitijtandon.github.io/publications/) tab for more.
